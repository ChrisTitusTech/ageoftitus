This is a list of essential tips and action priority for Age of Empires IV.<!--more-->

### Top Priority

- Always be building Villagers
  - 100+ Total Villagers before stopping
  - Benchmarks
    - 10 Minutes - 36 Villagers
    - 20 Minutes - 66 Villagers
    - 31 Minutes - 100 Villagers
- Don't Hoard Resources **Pro Players play below 100-200 Total Resources until population capped**
  - Beginner Benchmarks
    - Below 10 Minutes - Less than 1000 Total Resources
    - Below 20 Minutes - Less than 2000 Total Resources
- Scout to build counters of opposition and check if your enemy is trading

### High Priority

These should be followed after you master the top priority list. If you aren't getting the top priority list down, don't worry about these, until you are consistently doing that.

- Upgrades
  - Prioritize Eco Upgrades 1st
  - Military unit upgrades on UNITS YOU USE and HAVE 2nd
  - Blacksmith upgrades 3rd (priority goes to arrows)
- Defense
  - Built outposts near gold
  - Wall vulnerable areas
    - *Note: Partial walls can be good for forcing enemy units into TC's line of sight*
    - *Note: Don't build walls so far away you can't defend them*
    - *Note: Walls slow down raids, but you need units to make them effective*
- Relics and Sacred Sites
  - *Note: If you are going for a relic, you should send scouts to find the location of the relic beforehand*
  - *Note: Sacred Sites are good for drawing out your enemy and gold generation*
- Trade Routes after you build the market
  - *Note: Trade Routes are essential for long games 25+ minutes as they generate lots of gold*
