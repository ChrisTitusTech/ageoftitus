For new RTS players the hardest thing to learn is resource allocation and unit production. Let's break this down so you win more games!

## The Golden Rule 

You should ALWAYS be producing units. When you look at the 7 newbie tips this says villagers. Well, this really should say UNITS (Villagers and Military). 

*Note: The one time you shouldn't or may hold back is for a Fast Castle timing or To get to the next age before your opponent.*

What does that mean? 

1. *Scenario 1* You have 2 barracks and they are constantly producing units but resources are piling up... Build another Barrack, Archery Range, or Stable to make more units and spend those resources
2. *Scenario 2* You Have 2 barracks but are NOT able to constantly produce units from them... You WASTED resources and should learn to build more production buildings based on your current income

## Understand Gather Times 

On top of production understand for food that the gather rates differ a LOT by food resource. Going out on Deer, Boars, and Shoreline fish are a top priority once you have map control. 

Villagers:

- Berries / non-Malian cattle: 0.66
- Sheep / farms: 0.75
- Malian cattle: 0.81
- Deer: 0.825
- Boars: 0.9
- Shoreline fish: 1

Fishing boats:

- Shoreline fish: 0.7
- Deep water fish: 0.9
- Lodya fishing ship on shoreline fish: 1.26
- Lodya fishing ship on deep water fish: 1.71

## Production Calculator

In the heat of battle it is hard to balance all the resources on the fly unless you play thousands of games. However, if you had too much of one resource look at why! ALWAYS BE ADJUSTING as needed. Build Orders from <https://aoe4guides.com/> help with this balance in the early game, but blindly learning the order will only help you for the first 15-20 minutes then you might be lost. These build orders are essentially doing the balancing for you.

How do you fix your BAD resource balance:
